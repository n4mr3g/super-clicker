## Super Clicker

After a failed attempt to develop a text-based and AI-powered RPG
called "Project Holodeck", I decided to reuse my assets and point the
project to a different direction. Lesson learned: it's good to work on
a great project you're passionate about, but it's even better to work
on a good project that won't leave you overwhelmed. Small project is
better than no project at all. No shame in starting small.

"Super Clicker" (soon to be renamed) is supposed to be a simple (or
super?) clicker game. Because there's nothing more satisfying than
clicking a thing, seeing an animation, some numbers going up, things
happening on the screen and all that. As soon as I'm done with that,
I'll be adding twists. One major feature is that every action from the
user will go immediately to a server to be validated. No cheating will
be possible (at least not by changing code in the browser).

## Next.js default Readme content

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
